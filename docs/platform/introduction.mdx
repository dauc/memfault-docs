Welcome to the Introduction to Memfault page. After reading this, you should
have familiarized yourself with the different features Memfault offers and how
you can use it to ship hardware products at the speed of software.

Memfault is a cloud platform that allows you and your team to continuously
monitor devices, debug firmware issues, and deploy OTA updates to your fleet.

Some facts about Memfault:

- Memfault is **embedded-first**: embedded systems and devices running on any
  RTOS or operating systems such as Android or Linux are supported.
- It **runs on any device**: from powerful SoCs down to MCUs with the most
  constrained capabilities, Memfault will fit snugly into your device.
- Our SDKs are made with **low and intermittent connectivity** in mind: if your
  device can only send out a small amount of data, you'll be able to ration it
  in chunks of the size you choose, and we'll take care of transporting it for
  you. If your device relies on a companion (such as a mobile phone) for
  Internet access, you can use it as a bridge. Granted, you can also post data
  directly from your device.
- **Privacy** is built into Memfault: you have full control over what your
  Memfault-enabled devices send to our servers.

Our platform is a **one-stop shop** for all the needs of your product. We
provide:

- Post-mortem debugging.
- Over-the-air (OTA) updates.
- Monitoring via metrics.

## Post-Mortem Debugging

Memfault keeps track of crashes automatically and will make traces available to
you on the Memfault dashboard as soon as they're uploaded.

Our web application offers a rich and complete view into your collected traces.
With them, there's no need to attach a debugger to the device, which would
require shipping it to your facility. Even if you have the device at hand,
you'll find Memfault traces to be a better place to debug, thanks to the myriad
of helpful visualizations and connected data we display from our parsing. You'll
find Memfault traces are useful to you even during development.

Reproducing customer issues is easier than ever before. Consider a workflow
where a customer support agent files a ticket for engineering that already
includes a Memfault link to the particular device that's having issues, or even
a link to the trace itself.

Memfault traces go through a process of deduplication, so that you don't have to
look at every single instance of a problem. A group of collected traces with the
same backtrace is called an Issue in Memfault. Even after deduplication, you can
still access all available traces of an Issue.

## Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates

Memfault changes the way teams prepare updates. Instead of handing a pilot
device over to QA and waiting for bugs to be found, to then fix them and repeat
the process, consider the following workflow:

- Using Memfault Cohorts, split your devices into a production Cohort and a beta
  Cohort.
- Configure an automatic update for devices in the beta Cohort.
- Begin collecting crash reports and metrics from beta.
- Once your software is ready, enable the update for all production devices.

Memfault OTA updates enable this streamlined workflow as well as complex setups
that may include staged rollouts, delta releases (also known as incremental
updates), and many more representable scenarios.

OTA updates provide increased velocity, reduce the risk of rolling out an
update, and offer visibility into team productivity.

To benefit from the increased velocity while still maintaining the high
standards of quality required by the nature of hardware products, use the rest
of the Memfault feature suite: Post-Mortem Debugging and Metrics.

To learn more about OTA updates and set up your project to use them, continue on
to [documentation on OTA updates](/docs/platform/ota).

## Monitoring via Metrics

Memfault makes it extremely easy to collect new data from your devices. In any
of our SDKs, it's a matter of writing two lines of C or Kotlin. Since Memfault
takes care of the plumbing and the multipart transport, adding a new metric does
not involve data scientists, your web backend team, or your mobile app
developers.

Adding metrics to your Memfault integration unlocks many features whose value
compounds with all other features of Memfault:

- Device Attributes and time-series data.
- A timeline view for every single device showcasing its metrics, including
  time-series data, reboots and crashes.
- Custom Metric charts that aggregate the value of your metrics across your
  fleet, sliced by Cohort or Software Version.
- Email alerts based on your own configured thresholds.
- A rich device search view that allows you to express the most complex queries.
- Device Sets: a way to visualize the change in the count resulting from device
  searches over time.
