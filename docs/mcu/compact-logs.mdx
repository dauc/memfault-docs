This tutorial will cover how to enable the compact log feature in the
[Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk). When
Compact logging is enabled, format strings will be replaced with an integer id
at compile time. When the log is captured only the arguments and integer id will
be serialized and sent to the Memfault cloud where the full format string will
be recovered.

This has several key benefits:

- Reduces storage for logs on device
- Reduces required bandwidth to send logs to Memfault cloud
- Reduces CPU overhead for storing logs by offloading printf

## Example

Today, once enabled, compact logs will be used when capturing
[trace events](/docs/mcu/trace-events) with logs.

Let's take a look at a quick example:

```c
MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(flash_error, "QSPI Flash Erase Failure: error code: 0x%x", 0x5);
```

With a formatted string we need to encode the string length as well as the
entire string in our binary message taking up 41 bytes

```plaintext
00000000: 5153 5049 2046 6c61 7368 2045 7261 7365  QSPI Flash Erase
00000010: 2046 6169 6c75 7265 3a20 6572 726f 7220   Failure: error
00000020: 636f 6465 3a20 3078 35                   code: 0x5
```

where as with a compact log we need to encode a integer id and the arguments to
be serialized which in this example takes a total of 5 bytes

```plaintext
00000000: 8218 8805                                ....
```

So in this example we are able to reduce the storage occupied by 88%!

## Integration Steps

### 1. Enable `MEMFAULT_COMPACT_LOG_ENABLE`

Add the following to your projects `memfault_platform_config.h`:

```c
//! @file memfault_platform_config.h

#define MEMFAULT_COMPACT_LOG_ENABLE 1
```

### 2. Add a log fmt section to your linker script

Locate the linker script for your project (usually ends with `.ld`) and add the
following to your linker script

```linker-script
    log_fmt 0xF0000000 (INFO):
    {
        /*
        some versions of binutils do not place the __start_SECTION automatic
        section symbol correctly by default, so explicitly add it here
        */
        __start_log_fmt = ABSOLUTE(.);
        KEEP(*(*.log_fmt_hdr))
        KEEP(*(log_fmt))
    }
```

## FAQ

### How do I fix "## operator not supported" compiler error?

Once enabled, if you see the following compiler error:

```plaintext
memfault/core/compiler_gcc.h:73:45: error: static assertion failed: "## operator not supported, enable gnu extensions on your compiler"
 #  define MEMFAULT_STATIC_ASSERT(cond, msg) _Static_assert(cond, msg)
```

Compact logging uses a
[GNU Compiler extension](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros)
which will remove the leading comma in `, ## __VA_ARGS__` if `__VA_ARGS__` is
empty. This particular extension has been implemented in most other modern
compilers including ARM Compiler 5, Clang & iccarm. All you need to do is make
sure you have enabled gnu extensions for your compiler of choice.

For GCC, this can be accomplished by adding `-std=gnu11` as an argument to your
compiler flag list

### I'm seeing an incorrect pointer value when trying to use the %p formatter.

When the `%p` format is used _and_ the argument is typed as a `char *` or
`char []`, it must be cast to a `void *`. If it is not cast, a string will be
serialized instead and an incorrect pointer value will be displayed in the
Memfault UI.

Here's an example of correct usage:

```c
// No cast necessary for pointer types that are not strings
int i = 0;
uint32_t *int_ptr =  &i;
MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG("String Pointer: %p", int_ptr);

// Cast necessary when pointer type is a string
const char *str = "hello world";
MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG("String Pointer: %p", (void *)str);
```
