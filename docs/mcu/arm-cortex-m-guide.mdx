## Overview

The following guide will walk you through step-by-step how to integrate and test
the Memfault SDK for a Cortex-M device using the GNU GCC, Clang, IAR, ARM MDK,
or TI ARM Compiler.

<FwSdkFeatures />

## Pre-Integration

### (Optionally) Collect a coredump capture using GDB

<TryFlow />

<ProjectAwareCreateAProject />

## Integration Steps

### Prepare folder for memfault-firmware-sdk & port

<CloneSdk />

### Add Sources to Build System

<AddSources />

### Core Dependencies

<CorePlatformDependencies />

### Reboot Tracking Dependencies

<RebootTrackingDependency />

### Logging Dependency

<LoggingDependency />

### Timer Dependencies

<MetricTimerDependency />

### RTOS Port Files

<RtosPorts />

### Register Assert Handler

<RegisterAssert />

### Implement Coredump Storage Dependency

<CoredumpDependency />

### Add a Unique Identifier to target

<AddBuildIdIntro />
<AddBuildId />

### Confirm Integration Links

At this point your project should compile and be able to boot. On startup you
should see some messaging like the following print when
`memfault_platform_boot()` is called:

```
[I] Memfault Build ID: cefaeb9407ab0dac7a5efe9fd510618ee21e9df7
[I] S/N: MFLT0123
[I] SW type: app-fw
[I] SW version: 1.0.0+cefaeb940
[I] HW version: dvt1
[I] Reset Reason, RESETREAS=0x4
[I] Reset Causes:
[I]  Software
[I] Memfault Initialized!
```

## Verification & Tuning Steps

With Memfault compiling into your build, it's now time to add some initial
instrumentation, and test the integration!

### Define First Trace Event

<DefineFirstTraceEvent />

### Define First Heartbeat

<DefineFirstHeartbeat />

### Add Test Commands to CLI

<AddCliTestCommands />

### Post Data to Cloud via Local Debug Setup

<PostChunksLocally />

### Upload Symbol File

<UploadSymbolFile />

### Troubleshooting Data Transfer

<DataTransferTroubleshooting />

## Data Transport Steps

With data collection verified locally, the final step is to push data
automatically to the Memfault cloud for analysis.

### Post Data to Cloud via Device Transport

<PublishDataToCloud />

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Linker "Duplicate definition" error for `HardFault_Handler` etc.

The Memfault SDK includes definitions for several exception handlers, for
example:

- `HardFault_Handler`
- `MemoryManagement_Handler`

etc.

See
[here](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/24f2c2627c9f20e921e61d1b635cab58f34af3b8/components/panics/src/memfault_fault_handling_arm.c#L399-L427)
for the implementation.

These handlers should replace the existing ones in your project. You can remove
the existing implementations entirely, or you can for mark them with the `weak`
attribute (eg, using the `MEMFAULT_WEAK` compiler-agnostic define) to avoid the
linker error.

### What is `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` / `memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range()`?

#### `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()`

`memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` tells the Memfault fault handler
which memory regions should be collected as part of a coredump. The Memfault SDK
by default will collect the CPU registers and various fault registers of
interest. `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` provides additional memory
regions, which could be the entire contents of RAM, or selected sections only
(the RAM-backed coredump storage provides a default implementation that collects
a portion of the current stack). Typically, if sufficient storage is available,
including the entire RAM regions in the coredump will provide the most
information on a crash.

#### `memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range()`

`memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range()` is used to filter out sections of
memory that should not be captured by the Memfault fault handler as part of a
coredump. It's necessary to prevent the core dump writer from attempting to copy
data from inaccessible memory regions, which would cause the core dump to fail.
We highly recommend implementing it; usually it's sufficient to set it up with
the accessible memory regions for that device, for example, a chip with a single
`0x40000` byte RAM section, starting at address `0x20000000`, would have an
implementation like:

```c
size_t memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range(void *start_addr,
                                                size_t desired_size) {
  // these values can be provided by the linker script, or explicitly defined
  const uint32_t RAM_ORIGIN = 0x20000000;
  const uint32_t RAM_LENGTH = 0x40000;

  struct {
    uint32_t start_addr;
    size_t length;
  } s_mcu_mem_regions[] = {
      {
          .start_addr = RAM_ORIGIN,
          .length = RAM_LENGTH,
      },
  };

  for (size_t i = 0; i < MEMFAULT_ARRAY_SIZE(s_mcu_mem_regions); i++) {
    const uint32_t lower_addr = s_mcu_mem_regions[i].start_addr;
    const uint32_t upper_addr = lower_addr + s_mcu_mem_regions[i].length;
    if ((uint32_t)start_addr >= lower_addr &&
        ((uint32_t)start_addr < upper_addr)) {
      return MEMFAULT_MIN(desired_size, upper_addr - (uint32_t)start_addr);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
