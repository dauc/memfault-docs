The Bort SDK contains built-in support for collecting various types of metrics
from Android devices.

Some are automatically collected, and some require configuration in the Memfault
dashboard.

To record custom metrics, see the
[Reporting APIs](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics).

:::info

Be sure to configure which metrics you would like to be
[Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) and
[Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics#attributes) in the Metrics Dashboard.

### Battery (and related) Metrics

**Collected Since Bort 3.0**

Bort collects metrics from the
[Android batterystats subsystem](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/setup-battery-historian).
This includes data from many components which may affect battery usage (Radio,
Wifi, Bluetooth, Screen, CPU, GPS), in addition to statistics about the battery
itself.

These metrics are displayed on the device timeline:

And several summary metrics are also available:

- `audio_on_ratio`
- `battery_health_not_good_ratio`
- `battery_level_pct_avg`
- `bluetooth_scan_ratio`
- `cpu_running_ratio`
- `cpu_resume_count_per_hour`
- `cpu_suspend_count_per_hour`
- `cpu_wake_count_per_hour`
- `doze_full_ratio`
- `doze_ratio`
- `gps_on_ratio`
- `max_battery_temp`
- `phone_radio_active_ratio`
- `phone_scanning_ratio`
- `phone_signal_strength_none_ratio`
- `phone_signal_strength_poor_ratio`
- `screen_on_ratio`
- `screen_brightness_light_or_bright_ratio`
- `wifi_on_ratio`
- `wifi_radio_active_ratio`
- `wifi_running_ratio`
- `wifi_scan_ratio`
- `wifi_signal_strength_poor_or_very_poor_ratio`

These metrics would be good candidates for Timeseries metrics, to monitor fleet
performance over time and find outlier devices.

### Device Temperatures

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort regularly collects several device temperature metrics:

- CPU
- Device Skin

These are reported with min/max/mean values each hour, for each available
sensor:

These metrics would be good candidates for Timeseries metrics, to monitor fleet
performance over time and find outlier devices.

### Storage Usage

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort regularly collects device storage usage metrics:

- `storage.primary.bytes_free`
- `storage.primary.bytes_total`
- `storage.primary.bytes_used`
- `storage.primary.percentage_used`

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-temp-min.png)

These metrics would be good candidates for Timeseries metrics, to monitor fleet
performance over time and find outlier devices.

### Installed App Versions

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort can collect installed app versions as metrics. These can be configured on
the Memfault Settings Dashboard, on the **Data Sources** tab, by entering
package names to collect:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-configure-app-versions-min.png)

Wildcards can be used, to collect multiple apps sharing the same package root.

Each collected version is stored as a metric, prefixed with `version.`:

These metrics would be good candidates for Attributes, to enable e.g. searching
for devices with a given app version installed, or checking the installed
versions on a specific device.

### System Properties

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort can collect Android System Properties. These can be configured on the
Memfault Settings Dashboard, on the **Data Sources** tab, by entering each
property to collect:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-configure-system-properties-min.png)

Each collected property is stored as a metric, prefixed with `sysprop.`:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-system-properties-min.png)

These metrics would be good candidates for Attributes, to enable e.g. searching
for devices with a given system property, or checking the properties for a
specific device.
