## Android SDK Bort 4.0

Memfault’s AOSP SDK “Bort” received a major
[update 4.0 with many improvements](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v400---february-09-2021)
such as additional support for Android 12 and multi-user compatibility.

We added [support for Custom Metrics](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics) so
that devices can report product-specific numerical values, strings, and state
transitions on regular intervals. Together with a growing set of
[built-in Metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics), this leads to a
powerful combination of **per-device debugging** (e.g. correlation of CPU
activity and battery voltage) and **fleet-wide insights** (e.g. “how many
devices exceed 80% of their storage” or “What is the average battery discharge
rate?”). The reported values contribute to the recently introduced
[Time-Series Metrics and Device Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics).

Another rather advanced feature enables devices without direct Internet
connection to report crashes and metrics to Memfault. Data is packaged as `.mar`
(Memfault Archive) files and vendors may upload them at a later time or upon
request (e.g. downloaded periodically via USB or in a local network by an
auxiliary device). This allows vendors to use Memfault in scenarios with strict
security requirements.

## Dashboard changes to charts

[Memfault’s Dashboard](/docs/platform/charts#overview-dashboard) provides an
overview of your fleet at a glance. We have updated the charts “Active Devices”
(more sources used as signal) and “Software Versions” (only active devices
considered) to better compare apples to apples.

The visible time range for “Software Versions” can now be changed from “2
months” all the way down to just “24 hours”. Since the same chart is now being
used on the [Cohort details page](/docs/platform/ota#cohorts-view), it not only
allows you to see long-term trends, but also acts as timely signal to observe
the effect of an ongoing OTA software rollout.

The charts “Seen Devices” and “Received Events” have been removed.

## General

- Added: Ability to create
  [Alerts on device threshold](/docs/platform/alerts#device-threshold-alerts)
  for Android projects
- Added: [Memfault CLI](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/#history) with
  support for delta releases
- Added: Batch resolve button on issue list
- Improved: More details on notification emails for issues
- Improved: Search UI for issues and devices (now with multi-select) in several
  places
- Improved: Crash analysis on Android (empty oopses, handling of missing Java
  exceptions)
- Improved: Device search fields (e.g. “software version” allows for prefix and
  exact search, “device id” better handles large number of values)
- Improved: Qualcomm support (better exception unwind, improved `.xed`
  processing, allow for reprocessing of queue, `.xed`/`.xcd` now visible on
  device timeline)
- Improved documentation:
  [FAQ on integration of ARM Cortex-M](/docs/mcu/arm-cortex-m-guide#frequently-asked-questions),
  Note about
  [Newlib C Assertion handler](/docs/mcu/self-serve/#newlib-c-library-asserth),
  more details on
  [How to Organize your Devices using Memfault](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets),
  many details on [Memfault’s Android SDK](/docs/android/introduction)
- Changed: Several charts on dashboard (see highlight section above), also
  “Active Devices” shows “weekly” by default
- Changed: Layout of header part on Device Details page (Cohort no longer
  editable on top of page but next to other fields)
- Fixed: Unable to create new Custom Metric Charts
- Fixed: API incorrectly handles delta releases in some cases
- Fixed: UI glitches on tooltip for software version in device search
- Fixed: Inconsistencies in device event log
- Fixed: Email addresses for user invites were treated as case-sensitive
- Fixed: Issue search for “first seen”
- Removed: Cohort selector on issue list in device details

## MCU SDK

In February, two SDK versions
[0.28.2](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0282-and-sdk-0281---feb-1-2022)
and
[0.29.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0290-and-sdk-0282---feb-28-2022)
were released. Here are some highlights:

- Updated [nRF91 sample test app](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160/memfault_demo_app) to
  be compatible with nRF Connect SDK 1.9 release
- Added a port to Particle's Device OS,
  see`[ports/particle/README.md](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/particle/README.md)`
- Utility function
  `[memfault_base64_encode_inplace](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/util/base64.h#L35)` for
  base64 encoding data in place
- More [reboot reason options](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/reboot_reason_types.h#L16):
  - `kMfltRebootReason_KernelPanic` for explicitly tracking fatal resets from
    within a OS or RTOS
  - `kMfltRebootReason_FirmwareUpdateError` for explicitly tracking resets due
    to firmware update failures or rollbacks
- Several internal improvements

## Android SDK

We have published the
[Bort AOSP SDK 4.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v400---february-09-2021)
which includes:

- Additional support for Android 12 (all the way down to Android 8)
- Support for [Custom Metrics](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics) (supporting
  [various system-wide built-in metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics)
  such as app versions, storage usage, temperature or selected system
  properties), see `Reporting` APIs in `reporting-lib`
- Support for devices without a direct Internet connection (see highlight
  section above)
- Update dependencies (Gradle, Kotlin, Android Gradle Plugin) and
  `compileSdkVersion` of 31
- Several other improvements (multi-user support, various bug fixes, build
  improvements)
- Several fixes (SELinux violations on recent targetSdkVersion, race condition
  if started via ContentProvider query, missing DropBoxManager entry in rare
  scenarios)
- Unfortunately,
  [two breaking changes](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/4.0-RC1/CHANGELOG.md)
