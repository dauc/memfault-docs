## Improved OTA with Version Matrix and Delta Releases

Memfault steps up
[OTA observability and release management](/docs/platform/ota). Use the new
[Version Matrix](/docs/platform/ota#cohort-version-management) (Fleet → Cohorts
→ Cohort Details) to learn about the version distribution of your devices (rows)
and which version your devices will be updated to via OTA (columns).

Changes to your software rollout (including
[percentages for staged rollouts](/docs/platform/ota/#staged-rollout-of-a-release))
are reflected in the matrix immediately. This is especially helpful when using
the newly introduced [Delta Releases](/docs/platform/ota/#delta-releases) that
describe a path between specific versions. Every software version, OTA release,
and number in the matrix is clickable to get to more details if needed.

Even complex and unusual scenarios are visible at a glance: devices with no
compatible OTA payload, devices with a higher version than the cohort’s target
release, must-pass-through releases and their effect, as well as many other edge
cases are represented with data that is always live.

The Version Matrix gives you confidence both while preparing your software
rollout and during the ongoing rollout, and it still helps you understand the
version distribution of your fleet when no further updates are planned.

## MCU SDK

In January, two SDK versions
[0.28.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0280-and-sdk-0273---jan-4-2022)
and
[0.28.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0281-and-sdk-0280---jan-20-2022)
were released. Here are some highlights:

- Added: Support for [custom string metrics](/docs/mcu/metrics-api/)
  via `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_set_string()`
- Added: Optional override flag to support unusual Zephyr data region setups
- Updated: `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_debug_print()` to also print current
  timer values
- Fix: Example for
  [STM32 QP/C](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/examples/qp)
- Fix: Proper URL encode all query params when checking for OTA via HTTP
- Fixes for STM32F7xx and STM32L4
  ([reported](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/pull/22) by
  [@schultetwin](https://github.com/schultetwin))
- Fix: Outdated comment in cmake/Memfault.cmake
  ([reported](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/issues/21) by
  [@C47D](https://github.com/C47D))

## Android SDK

There was no new version of
[Bort, the Memfault AOSP SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort), in January.
